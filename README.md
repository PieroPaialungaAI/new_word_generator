# New Word Generator using OpenAI ChatGPT API 
Hello :smiley: thank you for being here!

This is a very simple Python project that uses the OpenAI Chatbot API to create a non existing word out of two existing ones and explain the fake meaning of the fake word üòÖ. The project has been turned into an app using **streamlit**.  Made during a sleepless night. Enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è

## 1. Application script

The application script uses the __streamlit__, that is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science. 
In order to run it, once you download the folder and the ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` file, you have to change the ```constants.py``` file and change it with the Open AI API key ‚Ä†. (Unfortunately, OpenAI blocks your keys when they are shared online, so mine wont work and you have to put yours).

‚Ä† If you do not have an Open AI API key, please follow the [Open AI blogpost](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/).

Once that you have followed the procedure, what you'd have to do is to run the app using:

```streamlit run app.py```

and follow the procedure that the app will ask you. You will have to write two different words. Press enter after each word has been written. Wait up and watch the magic happen. 

The app will provide the details of everything that is happening, the summary and the work experience proposal will be printed and the result will be a text with the fake word and the explanation of what that fake word means. :rocket:
